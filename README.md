## 🚀 Getting Started

> 📦 This repo is a monorepo using [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) for managing all exercises and solutions.

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure pnpm and node are installed and in the correct version

```bash
node -v // v23
pnpm -v // 10.17 or higher
```

### ✅ 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inovexAcademy/vue-training-advanced.git
cd vue-training-advanced
```

### ✅ 2. Install dependencies (all at once)

```bash
pnpm install
```

> This installs all exercises and solutions in one go via `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

### ✅ 3. Start an exercise

Go into the desired exercise folder and run the dev server:

```bash
cd _exercises/01-Advanced-Reactivity
pnpm dev
```

or use the more convenient shortcut from the root of the repo with

```bash
pnpm start:1
```

> You can work on exercises one-by-one. They’re isolated and ready-to-run.
