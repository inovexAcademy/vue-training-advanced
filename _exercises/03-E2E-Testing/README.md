# Exercise E2E Testing

The goal of this exercise is to learn writing E2E tests with Playwright.

As a starting point, we created two test files in the `/tests` directory: `add-to-cart.spec.ts` and `product-details.spec.ts`.

> 💡 We recommend running Playwright in [UI mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode) and already created a start script for you: `pnpm run test:e2e:ui`

## 📝 Tasks

- [ ] The added spec files do not contain any actual test yet, only the preparation.
      Add a test for the user flow of adding a product to the shopping cart

- [ ] Now try coming up with sensible user flows, then write tests for them with Playwright! You got this!
